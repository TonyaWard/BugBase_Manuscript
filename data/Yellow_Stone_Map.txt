The PCR primers (F515/R806) were developed against the V4 region of the 16S rRNA (both bacteria and archaea), which we determined would yield optimal community clustering with reads of this length using a procedure similar to that of ref. 15. [For reference, this primer pair ampli_es the region 533_786 in the Escherichia coli strain 83972 sequence (greengenes accession no. prokMSA_id:470367).] The reverse PCR primer is barcoded with a 12-base errorcorrecting Golay code to facilitate multiplexing of up to Â 1,500 samples per lane, and both PCR primers contain sequencer adapter regions. The three sequencing primers include two for reading in from each end of the amplicon and a third for reading the barcode. Because of technical limitations at the sequencing facility, only part of the barcode was sequenced, so we were unable to exploit the error-correcting properties fully; however, even with partial barcodes we were able to resolve the samples, demonstrating the robustness of the approach.

The PCR primers (F515/R806) were developed against the V4 region of the 16S rRNA (both bacteria and archaea), which we determined would yield optimal community clustering with reads of this length using a procedure similar to that of ref. 15. [For reference, this primer pair ampli_es the region 533_786 in the Escherichia coli strain 83972 sequence (greengenes accession no. prokMSA_id:470367).] The reverse PCR primer is barcoded with a 12-base errorcorrecting Golay code to facilitate multiplexing of up to Â 1,500 samples per lane, and both PCR primers contain sequencer adapter regions. The three sequencing primers include two for reading in from each end of the amplicon and a third for reading the barcode. Because of technical limitations at the sequencing facility, only part of the barcode was sequenced, so we were unable to exploit the error-correcting properties fully; however, even with partial barcodes we were able to resolve the samples, demonstrating the robustness of the approach.

Our results illustrate interesting and correlated patterns based on analysis of the unpaired reads (i.e., _ and _ diversity evaluations based on the 5_ only and 3_ only reads independently achieve similar results, suggesting that 100 bases in this region of the 16S gene can allow for successful screening and comparison of microbial communities).
